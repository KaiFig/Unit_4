# Unit 4 project

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
When I brainstormed with my client (myself) about problems I face and a SNS that would solve that, I realized that in school, we are not able to share recipes that we make, which is a shame as we come from such a diverse background and have lots of new and interesting recipes to share. At school, unless we are close to someone, we usually do not get the opportunity to cook with them or learn their recipes. Also, even if I search online, it is hard to get help on a recipe as I don't know them, and there are usually no ways of contacting them. Therefore, an SNS would enable messaging for help. Additionally, whenever I go to the supermarket, since I go there without a shopping list for recipes, I end up buying more than I need. This contributes to increased spending, and also, since I am not able to use everything, it makes me waste food. I have tried writing my own shopping list by looking at the recipe before and writing stuff down, however I have forgotten a nmber of things before so it's not the most effective. As proof of this, the notest taken from the brainstorming session are listed in the appendix.
