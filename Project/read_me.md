# Unit 4 project

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
When I brainstormed with my client (myself) about problems I face and a SNS that would solve that, I realized that in school, we are not able to share recipes that we make, which is a shame as we come from such a diverse background and have lots of new and interesting recipes to share. At school, unless we are close to someone, we usually do not get the opportunity to cook with them or learn their recipes. Also, even if I search online, it is hard to get help on a recipe as I don't know them, and there are usually no ways of contacting them. Therefore, an SNS would enable messaging for help. Additionally, whenever I go to the supermarket, since I go there without a shopping list for recipes, I end up buying more than I need. This contributes to increased spending, and also, since I am not able to use everything, it makes me waste food. I have tried writing my own shopping list by looking at the recipe before and writing stuff down, however I have forgotten a nmber of things before so it's not the most effective. As proof of this, the notest taken from the brainstorming session are listed in the appendix. 
　
## Proposed solution
To solve my client’s issue I will be creating a social media site using HTML CSS and Python. This site will allow the end user to share their own recipes and other users to share theirs as well. Additionally, they will be able to comment on the individual posts and make a shopping list


## Rationale for proposed solution

**Design statement:**
I will to design and make a social medai site for a client who is a high school student that is interested in cooking. The SNS will be about sharing and viewing other peoples recipes and is constructed using the software CSS, HTML and Python. It will take 4 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A, B, C, D, and E. 


## Success criteria
1. The user can upload their own recipes as a social media post
2. The user can view other social media posts
3. User can comment on other social media posts
4. Users are able to create their own shopping list in the app
5. Users can search recipes based on ingredients 
6. There is a secure login and registration page for each user
